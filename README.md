# Potato-Disease-Classification

## Problem Statement
In the agricultural sector, farmers frequently face substantial losses due to crop diseases. Potato crops, in particular, are vulnerable to diseases such as early blight and late blight. Detecting and predicting these diseases in advance could significantly reduce the impact of such outbreaks on farming yields. The objective of this project is to develop a solution that aids farmers in mitigating losses by enabling them to identify the health status of their potato plants using a mobile application.

## Solution

To address the challenges faced by farmers in detecting diseases in potato crops, this project proposes the development of a mobile application. The application allows farmers to capture images of potato leaves using their smartphones. Leveraging machine learning techniques and image analysis, the application then analyzes these images to determine whether the potato plant is healthy or affected by diseases like early blight or late blight.
